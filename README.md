# Prediction-of-the-usage-of-bikes-in-NY
We have used R and Tableau to create two stages in this project:- 
Exploratory Analysis:- Using R and Tableau to understand the connection between different variables and their impact on the entire data in the data set. Additionally, Data cleaning was performed. 
Predictive Analysis:- Time series analysis was used to predict the usage of bikes in NY. Firstly, the dataset was decomposed to understand the trends, patterns, and seasonality. Secondly,TSLM model was used to predict the outcome of the variable.
